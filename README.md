# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques


In this project we signed up for the Kaggle competition. The aim was to complete the competition and submit the code for rank. 
Then improve the code for better analysis to improve the rank. The competition we entered was “House Prices: Advanced Regression 
Techniques”. The competition details can be found on site: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques. 
We implemented different advanced regression algorithms and compared the results for best prediction.

Following are the details for the project implementations:
Dataset: Provided by Kaggle and in known as Ames Housing Dataset
Data Mining Tool: Python scikit library.
Analysis & Prediction:
Prediction of the sale price of the houses
Algorithms: The following algorithms were implemented in the project:
Advanced Regression Techniques like LASSO, XgBoost, PCA etc.
